# discord-bot
Developed in Python using open-source APIs, the bot roleplays a fun persona while assisting Discord servers in accessing additional music control, chat moderator, and gameplay tools. 
<br />
<h6>Music Control tools</h6> Users can command bot to join server voice channels as an entity and automatically play through listed music queues.
<br />
<h6>Chat Moderator tools</h6> Permitted users are able to use bot to detect, censor, and/or record published user messages within the Discord chatroom.
<br />
<h6>Minigame tools</h6> Users are able to gain access to a variety of small minigames. 
<br />
<h6>Competitive Gameplay tools</h6> This feature acts as a competitive gameplay software tool for League of Legends players. 
<br />
Users are given the ability to quickly search up previous performance history of teammates and opponents in real-time, allowing players to make improved strategic decisions based on calculated statistics. Created using Riot Games Developer API to track live gameplay statistics. 
<br />
Player data is transferred using JSON files and algorithmically arranged to effectively assist players in identifying statistically-proven strengths and weaknesses of their teammates and opponents.
